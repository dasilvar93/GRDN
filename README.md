Group members: Joshua Grant, Kyle de Silva, Brett Pasula 

Potential names: GRDN, GRDNR, Phyto 

## Project description:  
- who is it for? Gardeners, landscapers, plant enthusiasts, etc. 
- what will it do? Track plants, notify user when plant maintenance is required (i.e. watering), allow user to search for plants that will grow in their area. 
- what type of data will it store? Data related to their plant "inventory", times since last maintenance (i.e. watering). 
- what will users be able to do with this data? Add plants to their inventory, search new plants to add, track maintenance. 
- what is some additional functionality you can add/remove based on time constraints? Spatial display, social media integration, photo imports from web (see "Stretch requirements" below).  

## Requirements: 

Minimal requirements (3-5) - will definitely complete: 
- plant search, select and store. 
- weather API integration. 
- suggestions based on location, weather, etc. 
- single garden management. 
- functional UI. 

Standard requirements (3-7) - will most likely complete: 
- slick UI with animations, smooth transitions etc.  
- multiple garden management. 
- rich data display on plants, plant needs, etc.  
- push notifications. 
- plant tracking functionality - add notes, etc. 
- add custom photos. 

Stretch requirements (2-3) - hope to complete one: 
- add a property display where people could place their plants relative to their home in space. 
- social media integration - share your garden with your friends! 
- import photos from Flickr, Instagram, Tumblr, etc.
